VisualNimrod
============

Visual studio language support for nimrod!

To install from source make sure you have the Visual Studio 2013 SDK
(http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40758). All that
is required is that you compile NimrodVS project, this will automatically
deploy VisualNimrod to the visual studio expermental instance, if you start
visual studio using this shortcut (the SDK adds it you your start menu/screen)
then you should see the new nimrod project type available.

If you do not feel like getting the SDK set up, you can find pre-release versions
in the github releases section. These are .vsix files and installation should be straight forward.
